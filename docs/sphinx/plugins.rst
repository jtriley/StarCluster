StarCluster Plugin System
=========================
StarCluster has support for user contributed plugins. Plugins allow developers to further configure the cluster on top of
the default cluster configuration provided by StarCluster. Plugins are used to provide custom cluster configurations for a variety
of computing needs.

Creating a New Plugin
---------------------
A StarCluster plugin is simply a Python class that extends **starcluster.clustersetup.ClusterSetup** and implements a *run* method.
This class must live in a module that is on the PYTHONPATH. By default, StarCluster will add the ~/.starcluster/plugins directory
to the PYTHONPATH automatically. The ~/.starcluster/plugins directory is not created automatically so you will need to create it if 
it does not exist.

Below is a very simple example of a StarCluster plugin that installs a package on each node using apt-get after the cluster has been 
configured:

.. code-block:: python

        from starcluster.clustersetup import ClusterSetup

        class PackageInstaller(ClusterSetup):
             def __init__(self, pkg_to_install):
                  self.pkg_to_install = pkg_to_install
             def run(self, nodes, master, user, user_shell, volumes):
                  for node in nodes:
                       node.ssh.execute('apt-get -y install %s' % self.pkg_to_install)

For this example we assume that this class lives in a module file called **ubuntu.py** and that this file lives in the
~/.starcluster/plugins directory.

This is a very simple example that simply demonstrates how to execute a command on each node in the cluster. For a more sophisticated
example, have a look at StarCluster's default setup class **starcluster.clustersetup.DefaultClusterSetup**. This is the class used to perform
StarCluster's default setup routines. The DefaultClusterSetup class should provide you with a more complete example of the plugin API and 
the types of things you can do with the arguments passed to a plugin's *run* method.

Using the Logging System
------------------------
When writing plugins it's better to use StarCluster's logging system rather than print statements in your code. This is because the logging system handles
formatting messages and writing them to the StarCluster debug file. Here's a modified version of the *PackageInstaller* plugin above that uses
the logging system:

.. code-block:: python

        from starcluster.clustersetup import ClusterSetup
        from starcluster.logger import log

        class PackageInstaller(ClusterSetup):
             def __init__(self, pkg_to_install):
                  self.pkg_to_install = pkg_to_install
                  log.debug('pkg_to_install = %s' % pkg_to_install)
             def run(self, nodes, master, user, user_shell, volumes):
                  for node in nodes:
                       log.info("Installing %s on %s" % (self.pkg_to_install, node.alias))
                       node.ssh.execute('apt-get -y install %s' % self.pkg_to_install)

The first thing you'll notice is that we've added an additional import statement to the code. This line imports the log object that you'll
use to log messages. In the plugin's constructor we've added a log.debug() call that shows the current value of the pkg_to_install variable.
All messages logged with the log.debug() method will always be printed to the debug file, however, these messages will only be printed to 
the screen if the user passes the --debug flag to the starcluster command.

In the plugin's *run* method, we've added a log.info() call to notify the user that the package they specified in the config is being installed on
a particular node. All messages logged with the log.info() method will always be printed to the screen and also go into the debug file. In addition
to log.info() and log.debug() there are also log.warn(), log.critical(), log.fatal(), and log.error() methods for logging messages of varying severity.

Adding Your Plugin to the Config
--------------------------------
To use a plugin we must first add it to the config and then add the plugin's config to a *cluster template*. Below is an example config
for the example plugin above:

.. code-block:: ini

        [plugin pkginstaller]
        setup_class = ubuntu.PackageInstaller
        pkg_to_install = htop

In this example, pkg_to_install is an argument to the plugin's constructor (ie __init__). A plugin can, of course, define multiple
construtor arguments and you can configure these arguments in the config similar to *pkg_to_install* in the above example.

After you've defined a **[plugin]** section, you can now use this plugin in a *cluster template* by configuring its **plugins** setting:

.. code-block:: ini

        [cluster smallcluster]
        ....
        plugins = pkginstaller

This setting instructs StarCluster to run the *pkginstaller* plugin after StarCluster's default setup routines. If you want to use more
than one plugin in a template you can do so by providing a list of plugins:

.. code-block:: ini

        [cluster smallcluster]
        ....
        plugins = pkginstaller, myplugin

In the example above, starcluster would first run the *pkginstaller* plugin and then the *myplugin* plugin afterwards. In short, order matters
when defining plugins to use in a *cluster template*.

Using the Development Shell
---------------------------
To launch StarCluster's development shell, use the *shell* command

.. code-block:: none

        $ starcluster shell
        StarCluster - (http://web.mit.edu/starcluster) (v. 0.9999)

        Please submit bug reports to starcluster@mit.edu

.. _IPython: http://ipython.scipy.org

This launches you into an IPython_ shell with all of the StarCluster modules automatically loaded. You'll also notice that you have the following
variables available to you automagically:

1. ec2 - object for interacting with EC2 (starcluster.awsutils.EasyEC2)
2. s3 - object for interacting with S3 (starcluster.awsutils.EasyS3)
3. cfg - object for retrieving values from the config file (starcluster.config.StarClusterConfig)

Plugin Development Workflow
---------------------------
The process of developing and testing a plugin generally goes something like this:

1. Start a small test cluster (2-3 nodes):

.. code-block:: none

        $ starcluster start testcluster -s 2 

2. Install and configure the additional software/settings by hand and note the steps involved

.. code-block:: none

        $ starcluster sshmaster testcluster 

3. Write a first draft of your plugin that attempts to do these steps programmatically

4. Add your plugin to the StarCluster configuration file

5. Launch the development shell and test your plugin on your small test cluster

.. code-block:: none

        $ starcluster shell
        [~]|1> cluster.run_plugin('myplugin', 'testcluster', cfg)

6. Fix any coding errors in order to get the plugin to run from start to finish using the run_plugin() method

7. Login to the master node and verify that the plugin was successful:
