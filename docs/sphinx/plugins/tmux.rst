TMUX Plugin
###########

``TMUX`` is a terminal multiplexer. It enables a number of terminals (or
windows), each running a separate program, to be created, accessed, and
controlled from a single screen. tmux may be detached from a screen and
continue running in the background, then later reattached.

``TMUX`` is especially useful when used on remote systems given that it will
automatically detach and background itself if the remote SSH connection breaks
saving your remote terminal sessions and running programs. You can then
reconnect later on and reattach your terminals and running programs.

This plugin will configure a ``TMUX`` session for your ``CLUSTER_USER`` that
contains a terminal session on each node in a separate ``TMUX`` window.

*****
Usage
*****
To use the ``TMUX`` plugin add a plugin section to your starcluster config file:

.. code-block:: ini

    [plugin tmux]
    setup_class = starcluster.plugins.tmux.TmuxControlCenter

Next update the ``PLUGINS`` setting in one or more of your cluster templates to
include the ``TMUX`` plugin:

.. code-block:: ini

    [cluster mycluster]
    plugins = tmux

The next time you start a cluster the ``TMUX`` plugin will automatically be
executed. If you already have a cluster running that didn't originally have
tmux in its plugin list you can manually run the plugin using::

    $ starcluster runplugin tmux mycluster
    StarCluster - (http://star.mit.edu/cluster)
    Software Tools for Academics and Researchers (STAR)
    Please submit bug reports to starcluster@mit.edu

    >>> Running plugin tmux
    >>> Starting TMUX Control Center...
    >>> Creating TMUX Control Center for user 'myuser'
    >>> Creating TMUX Control Center for user 'root'

Next login as root or ``CLUSTER_USER`` and use your cluster ``TMUX`` session::

    $ starcluster sshmaster mycluster -u myuser
    myuser@master $ tmux a

This will attach your terminal to the remote ``TMUX`` session. It should look
something like this:

.. image:: /_static/tmuxcc.png

You'll notice at the bottom there are 4 windows open. Since this is a 3-node
cluster the first window is split into 3 panes with each pane logged into a
separate node. The remaining 3 windows are all individual SSH sessions to each
node in the cluster. If the cluster is large, you will notice multiple ``all``
windows each containing a group of panes logged into a subset of the cluster
nodes. This avoids the ``all`` windows being split so much that the terminals
are unusable. Read the next section to learn how to use navigate these ``TMUX``
windows/panes.

****************
Basic TMUX Usage
****************
In order to take full advantage of ``TMUX`` you need to become familiar with
some of the basic keyboard shortcut commands. It is highly recommended that you
read this `blog post`_ for an excellent tutorial on how to use ``TMUX``. Below
are the basic keyboard shortcuts for reference:

.. note::

    If youâ€™re used to screen or don't care for prefixing commands with Ctrl-b
    you can change this by putting the following in your ``$HOME/.tmux.conf``:

    ``set -g prefix Ctrl-a``

    You can then replace ``Ctrl-b`` with ``Ctrl-a`` in the shortcuts listed below.

+--------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| Command      | Description                                      |

| **Ctrl-b d** | Detach current client                            |
