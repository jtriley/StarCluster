0.93.1
======

.. _v0931-news:

News
----
.. warning:: It is recommended that you upgrade as soon as possible.

Version 0.93.1 of StarCluster is largely a patch release that fixes several
bugs. See the "Bug Fixes" section below for details.


Also, the ``put`` and ``get`` commands have been marked stable which means they
no longer require ``ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL=True`` in the config in order to use
them.

.. _v0931-features:

Features
--------
* Added sys.argv to crash reports for better details when things go wrong
* Implemented on_add_node and on_remove_node for TMUX plugin to add/remove
  nodes from the TMUX control-center sessions for both ``root`` and
  ``CLUSTER_USER``
* Implemented on_add_node for the Ubuntu package installer plugin
  (``pkginstaller``) to ensure new nodes also install the required packages
* Implemented on_add_node for the MPICH2 plugin to ensure new nodes are
  configured for MPICH2 and also added to the hosts file. Moved the MPICH2
  hosts file to an NFS-shared location (``/home/mpich2.hosts``) for faster
  configuration
* Implemented on_add_node for the Xvfb plugin that installs and runs Xvfb on
  newly added nodes

.. _v0931-fixes:

Bug Fixes
---------
* Fixed major NFS bug in ``addnode`` command where ``/etc/exports`` was being
  wiped each time a new node was added. This caused the last-to-be-added node
  to be the only node correctly configured for NFS in the entire cluster.
* Updated all plugins which subclass DefaultClusterSetup to implement
  on_add_node and on_remove_node regardless of whether or not they actually use
  them to avoid the 'default' plugin's implementation being incorrectly called
  multiple times by plugins when adding/removing nodes using the ``addnode``
  and ``removenode`` commands
* Fixed string formatting bug in Condor plugin

News
----
New StarCluster Ubuntu 11.10 EBS AMIs available including a new HVM AMI for use
with CC/CC2/CG instance types! Includes OpenGridScheduler (to replace SGE),
Condor, Hadoop/Dumbo, MPICH2, OpenMPI, IPython 0.12 (parallel+notebook), and
more. Run ``dpkg -l`` on the AMIs for the full list of packages.

The new StarCluster Ubuntu 11.10 EBS HVM AMI additionally comes with NVIDIA
driver, CUDA Toolkit/SDK, PyCuda, PyOpenCL, and Magma for GPU computing.

These new AMIs are available in all AWS regions. The new ``us-east-1`` 11.10
EBS AMIs are now the defaults in the StarCluster config template. Use the
``listpublic`` command to obtain a list of available StarCluster AMIs in other
regions::

    $ starcluster -r sa-east-1 listpublic

.. note::

    The **HVM** AMI is currently only available in the ``us-east-1`` region
    until other regions support HVM.

.. _v093-features:

Features
--------
* Added support for new CC2 instance types

* Added support for specifying a proxy host to use when connecting to AWS::

   [aws info]
   aws_proxy = your.proxy.com
   aws_proxy_port = 8080
   aws_proxy_user = yourproxyuser
   aws_proxy_pass = yourproxypass

  See :ref:`proxy-config` for more details

* Updated IPCluster plugin to support IPython 0.12 with :ref:`parallel
  <using-ipython-cluster>` and :ref:`notebook <ipython-notebook>`
  support (SSL+password auth). See :ref:`ipcluster-plugin` for more details

* Keypairs are now validated against EC2 fingerprint which notifies users ahead
  of time if the file they specified in KEY_LOCATION doesn't match the EC2
  keypair specified

* Support for Windows (tested on 32bit Windows 7). See :ref:`windows-install`
  for more details

New Plugins
^^^^^^^^^^^
* **Condor** - experimental support for creating a Condor pool on StarCluster.
  See :ref:`condor-plugin` for more details
* **Hadoop** - support for creating a Hadoop cluster with StarCluster
  See :ref:`hadoop-plugin` for more details
* **MPICH2** - configure cluster to use MPICH2 instead of OpenMPI
  See :ref:`mpich2-plugin` for more details
* **TMUX** - configures cluster SSH "dashboard" in tmux
  See :ref:`tmux-plugin` for more details
* **Package installer** - install Ubuntu packages on all nodes concurrently
  See :ref:`pkginstaller-plugin` for more details
* **Xvfb** - install and configure an Xvfb session on all nodes (``sets
  DISPLAY=:1``) See :ref:`xvfb-plugin` for more details
* **MySQL** - install and configure a MySQL cluster on StarCluster. See
  :ref:`mysql-plugin` for more details

.. _v093-fixes:

Bug Fixes
---------
* Fix bug in ``put`` command where in random cases the last few bytes of the
  file weren't being transferred
* Raise an error if placement group creation fails
* Fix bug in terminate command in the case that nodes are already
  ``shutting-down`` when the terminate command is executed
* Fix bug in s3image when destination S3 bucket already exists
* Fix known_hosts warnings when ssh'ing from node to node internally
* Fix trivial logging bug in createvolume command

.. _version-0.92.1:

0.92.1
======
:release-date: 11-05-2011

.. _v0921-features:

Features
--------
* Support for splitting the config into an arbitrary set of files::

    [global]
    include=~/.starcluster/awscreds, ~/.starcluster/myconf

  See :ref:`splitting-the-config` for more details

* createvolume: support naming/tagging newly created volumes::

    $ starcluster createvolume --name mynewvol 30 us-east-1d

  See :ref:`create-and-format-ebs-volumes` for more details

* listvolumes: add support for filtering by tags::

    $ starcluster listvolumes --name mynewvol
    $ starcluster listvolumes --tag mykey=myvalue

  See :ref:`managing-ebs-volumes` for more details

* sshmaster, sshnode, sshinstance: support for running remote
  commands from command line::

    $ starcluster sshmaster mycluster 'cat /etc/fstab'
    $ starcluster sshnode mycluster node001 'cat /etc/fstab'
    $ starcluster sshinstance i-99999999 'cat /etc/hosts'

  See :doc:`manual/runcommands` for more details

.. _v0921-fixes:

Bug Fixes
---------
The following bugs were fixed in this release:

**spothistory command**

* add package_data to sdist in order to include the necessary web media and
  templates needed for the ``--plot`` feature. The previous 0.92 version left
  these out and thus the ``--plot`` feature was broken. This should be fixed.

* fix bug when launching default browser on mac

**start command**

* fix bug in option completion when using the start command's
  ``--cluster-template`` option

**terminate command**

* fix bug in terminate cmd when region != us-east-1

**listkeypairs command**

* fix bug in list_keypairs when no keys exist

Improvements
------------
* listinstances: add 'state_reason' msg to output if available
* add system info, Python info, and package versions to crash-report
* listregions: sort regions by name
* improved bash/zsh completion support. completion will read from the correct
  config file, if possible, in the case that the global -c option is specified
  while completing.
* separate the timing of cluster setup into time spent on waiting for EC2
  instances to come up and time spent configuring the cluster after all
  instances are up and running. this is useful when profiling StarCluster's
  performance on large (100+ node) clusters.

:release-date: 10-17-2011

.. _v092-news:

News
----
.. note::

    Before upgrading please be aware that rc1 does not support clusters created
    with previous versions and will print a warning along with instructions on
    how to proceed if it finds old clusters. With that said, it's best not to
    upgrade until you've terminated any currently running clusters created with
    an old version. Also, the @sc-masters group is no longer needed and can be
    removed after upgrading by running "starcluster terminate masters"

You can find the new docs for 0.92rc1 here:

http://web.mit.edu/stardev/cluster/docs/0.92rc1/

NOTE: these docs are still very much a work in progress. If anyone is
interested in helping to improve the docs, please fork the project on github
and submit pull requests. Here's a guide to get you started:

http://web.mit.edu/stardev/cluster/docs/0.92rc1/contribute.html

Please upgrade at your leisure, test the new release candidate, and submit any
bug reports preferably on StarCluster's github issue tracker or this mailing
list.

.. _v092-features:

Features
--------
* Cluster Compute/GPU Instances- Added support for the new Cluster
  Compute/GPU instance types. Thanks to Fred Rotbart for his contributions

* EBS-Backed Clusters- Added support for starting/stopping EBS-backed
  clusters on EC2. The ``stop`` command now stops (instead of terminate)
  an EBS-backed cluster and terminates an S3-backed cluster. Added a
  terminate command that terminates *any* cluster

* Improved performance - using workerpool library
  (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/StarCluster) to configure nodes concurrently

* New ``ebsimage`` and ``s3image`` commands for easily creating new EBS-backed
  AMIs. Each command supports creating a new AMI from S3 and EBS-backed image
  hosts respectively. (NOTE: ``createimage`` has been renamed to s3image. you can
  still call ``createimage`` but this will go away in future releases)

* Add/Remove Nodes - added new ``addnode`` and ``removenode`` commands for
  adding/removing nodes to a cluster and removing existing nodes from a cluster

* Restart command - Added new restart command that reboots the cluster and
  reconfigures the cluster

* Create Keypairs - Added ability to add/list/remove keypairs

* Elastic Load Balancing - Support for shrinking/expanding clusters based on Sun
  Grid Engine queue statistics. This allow the user to start a single-node
  cluster (or larger) and scale the number of instances needed to meet the
  current SGE queue load. For example, a single-node cluster can be launched and
  as the queue load increases new EC2 instances are launched, added to the
  cluster, used for computation, and then removed when they're idle. This
  minimizes the cost of using EC2 for an unknown and on-demand workload. Thanks
  to Rajat Banerjee (rqbanerjee)

* Security Group Permissions - Added ability to specify permission settings to
  be applied automatically to a cluster's security group after it's been started

* Multiple Instance Types - Added support for specifying instance types on a
  per-node basis. Thanks to Dan Yamins for his contributions

* Unpartitioned Volumes- StarCluster now supports both partitioned and
  unpartitioned EBS volumes

* New Plugin Hooks - Plugins can now play a part when adding or removing a node as
  well as when restarting or shutting down the entire cluster by implementing the
  ``on_remove_node``, ``on_add_node``, ``on_shutdown``, and ``on_reboot``
  methods respectively

* Added a ``runplugin`` command and fixed the run_plugin() method in the
  development shell. You can now run a plugin in the dev shell like so::

    ~[1]> cm.run_plugin('myplugin', 'mycluster')

* Added support for easily switching regions (without config changes)
  using a global -z option. For example::

    $ starcluster -r eu-west-1 listclusters
    StarCluster - (http://web.mit.edu/starcluster) (v. 0.92rc1)
    Software Tools for Academics and Researchers (STAR)
    Please submit bug reports to starcluster@mit.edu

    >>> No clusters found...

* Added new ``resizevolume`` command for easily resizing existing EBS volumes

* Added listregions/listzones commands
