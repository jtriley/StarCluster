News
----
Version 0.95.3 of StarCluster is a bug fix release. StarCluster no longer
assigns public IPs for non-default VPC clusters by default now because of the
following issues:

1. It opens up the VPC to the internet by default which is a security risk
2. It requires a special VPC configuration (internet gateway attached to the
   VPC and a route to the gateway with dest CIDR block 0.0.0.0/0 associated
   with the VPC subnet).  Configuring this automatically (which does not happen
   currently) would be a security risk and without this configuration
   StarCluster cannot connect to the VPC nodes even though they've been
   assigned a public IP.  See :ref:`connect-vpc` for more details.

Users can still enable public IPs for their non-default VPC clusters via the
``PUBLIC_IPS`` config setting or the new ``--public-ips`` option to the
``start`` command assuming they've properly configured their VPC to use public
IPs. If the VPC hasn't been properly configured for public IPs an error will be
raised during validation. The ``--no-public-ips`` option has been preserved so
that users can disable the config setting (``PUBLIC_IPS``) from the ``start``
command. Please see :ref:`using-vpc` and :ref:`connect-vpc` for more details.

Please note that this version is *not* compatible with clusters started with
older versions of StarCluster. Please terminate all clusters before upgrading
to 0.95.3.

.. _v0953-fixes:

Features
--------
* start: add -Q, -p, and --no-spot-master options
* cluster: update 'Creating cluster' log msg to indicate VPC

Bug Fixes
---------
* users: pass -n to echo to avoid trailing newlines (gh-375)
* cluster: do not use public IPs with VPC by default (gh-372)
* cluster: fix VPC public IPs validation

.. _version-0.93.2:

0.93.2
======

.. _v0932-news:

News
----
Version 0.93.2 of StarCluster fixes several bugs and adds a couple new
features. See the "Bug Fixes" section below for details.

* Amazon recently announced a new instance type ``m1.medium`` which is now
  supported. Amazon also enabled the m1.small and c1.medium instance types to
  be compatible with both 32bit *and* 64bit AMIs now. StarCluster now supports
  the new ``m1.medium`` instance type as well as the new changes to
  ``m1.small`` and ``c1.medium``.
* Switched from paramiko to actively maintained fork called `ssh` (1.7.13)
* loadbalancer: ``--kill-master`` option renamed to ``--kill-cluster``
* Bumped boto dep to 2.2.2
* Bumped jinja dep to 2.6

.. _v0932-features:

Features
--------
* SGE setup code has been moved to a plugin that is executed by default (**no
  configuration changes required**). This plugin supports an optional setting
  ``master_is_exec_host`` which controls whether or not the master node
  executes jobs. This is set to ``True`` by default. To change this you will
  need to set ``disable_queue=True`` in your cluster config and then manually
  define and add the SGE plugin in order to configure the new plugin's
  settings. See :ref:`sge-plugin` for more details.
* Added the following new options to ``addnode`` command: ``--image-id``,
  ``--instance-type``, ``--availability-zone``, ``--bid``. Thanks to Dan Yamins
  for his contributions. (issue 76)
* New ``CreateUsers`` plugin that creates multiple cluster users and configures
  passwordless SSH. Either number of users or a list of usernames can be
  specified. Also has options to tar and download all SSH keys for generated
  users. See :ref:`users-plugin` for more details.
* Added -X option to ``sshmaster`` and ``sshnode`` commands for forwarding X11.
  Can be used both when logging in interactively and when executing remote
  commands.

.. _v0932-fixes:

Bug Fixes
---------
* catch `Garbage packet received` exception and warn users about incompatible
  AMI
* ``createvolume``: support new /dev/xvd* device names
* fix textwrap error with python 2.5 (issue 85)
* ``sshmaster``, ``sshnode``: load /etc/profile by default when executing
  remote cmds
* ``terminate``: handle Ctrl-D gracefully when prompting for input (issue 80)
* ``terminate``: ignore keys when terminating manually
* validate key_location is readable (issue 77)
* relax validation constraints for running instances when using ``starcluster
  start -x`` (issue 78)
* fix cluster validation for `t1.micro` AMIs/instance types
* ``loadbalance``: fix _get_stats when no exec hosts
* ``loadbalance``: respect min_nodes when removing nodes (issue 75)
* ``loadbalance``: fix -K option to kill cluster when queue is empty (issue 86)
* ``loadbalance``: retry fetching stats 5x before failing (issue 65)
* skip NFS exports setup when there are no worker nodes
* sge: configure SGE profile on all nodes concurrently
* sge: use qconf's -\*attr commands to update cluster config (replaced a bunch
  of ugly code that parsed SGE's console output)
* add Changelog to MANIFEST.in in order to include Changelog in future release
  dists

.. _version-0.93.1:

0.93.1
======

.. _v0931-news:

News
----
.. warning:: It is recommended that you upgrade as soon as possible.

Version 0.93.1 of StarCluster is largely a patch release that fixes several
bugs. See the "Bug Fixes" section below for details.


Also, the ``put`` and ``get`` commands have been marked stable which means they
no longer require ``ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL=True`` in the config in order to use
them.

.. _v0931-features:

Features
--------
* Added sys.argv to crash reports for better details when things go wrong
* Implemented on_add_node and on_remove_node for TMUX plugin to add/remove
  nodes from the TMUX control-center sessions for both ``root`` and
  ``CLUSTER_USER``
* Implemented on_add_node for the Ubuntu package installer plugin
  (``pkginstaller``) to ensure new nodes also install the required packages
* Implemented on_add_node for the MPICH2 plugin to ensure new nodes are
  configured for MPICH2 and also added to the hosts file. Moved the MPICH2
  hosts file to an NFS-shared location (``/home/mpich2.hosts``) for faster
  configuration
* Implemented on_add_node for the Xvfb plugin that installs and runs Xvfb on
  newly added nodes

.. _v0931-fixes:

Bug Fixes
---------
* Fixed major NFS bug in ``addnode`` command where ``/etc/exports`` was being
  wiped each time a new node was added. This caused the last-to-be-added node
  to be the only node correctly configured for NFS in the entire cluster.
* Updated all plugins which subclass DefaultClusterSetup to implement
  on_add_node and on_remove_node regardless of whether or not they actually use
  them to avoid the 'default' plugin's implementation being incorrectly called
  multiple times by plugins when adding/removing nodes using the ``addnode``
  and ``removenode`` commands
* Fixed string formatting bug in Condor plugin

.. _version-0.92.1:

0.92.1
======
:release-date: 11-05-2011

.. _v0921-features:

Features
--------
* Support for splitting the config into an arbitrary set of files::

    [global]
    include=~/.starcluster/awscreds, ~/.starcluster/myconf

  See :ref:`splitting-the-config` for more details

* createvolume: support naming/tagging newly created volumes::

    $ starcluster createvolume --name mynewvol 30 us-east-1d

  See :ref:`create-and-format-ebs-volumes` for more details

* listvolumes: add support for filtering by tags::

    $ starcluster listvolumes --name mynewvol
    $ starcluster listvolumes --tag mykey=myvalue

  See :ref:`managing-ebs-volumes` for more details

* sshmaster, sshnode, sshinstance: support for running remote
  commands from command line::

    $ starcluster sshmaster mycluster 'cat /etc/fstab'
    $ starcluster sshnode mycluster node001 'cat /etc/fstab'
    $ starcluster sshinstance i-99999999 'cat /etc/hosts'

  See :doc:`manual/runcommands` for more details

.. _v0921-fixes:

Bug Fixes
---------
The following bugs were fixed in this release:

**spothistory command**

* add package_data to sdist in order to include the necessary web media and
  templates needed for the ``--plot`` feature. The previous 0.92 version left
  these out and thus the ``--plot`` feature was broken. This should be fixed.

* fix bug when launching default browser on mac

**start command**

* fix bug in option completion when using the start command's
  ``--cluster-template`` option

**terminate command**

* fix bug in terminate cmd when region != us-east-1

**listkeypairs command**

* fix bug in list_keypairs when no keys exist

Improvements
------------
* listinstances: add 'state_reason' msg to output if available
* add system info, Python info, and package versions to crash-report
* listregions: sort regions by name
* improved bash/zsh completion support. completion will read from the correct
  config file, if possible, in the case that the global -c option is specified
  while completing.
* separate the timing of cluster setup into time spent on waiting for EC2
  instances to come up and time spent configuring the cluster after all
  instances are up and running. this is useful when profiling StarCluster's
  performance on large (100+ node) clusters.

News
----
.. note::

    Before upgrading please be aware that rc1 does not support clusters created
    with previous versions and will print a warning along with instructions on
    how to proceed if it finds old clusters. With that said, it's best not to
    upgrade until you've terminated any currently running clusters created with
    an old version. Also, the @sc-masters group is no longer needed and can be
    removed after upgrading by running "starcluster terminate masters"

You can find the new docs for 0.92rc1 here:

http://star.mit.edu/cluster/docs/0.92rc1/

NOTE: these docs are still very much a work in progress. If anyone is
interested in helping to improve the docs, please fork the project on github
and submit pull requests. Here's a guide to get you started:

http://star.mit.edu/cluster/docs/0.92rc1/contribute.html

  clusters on EC2. The ``stop`` command now stops (instead of terminate)
  an EBS-backed cluster and terminates an S3-backed cluster. Added a
  terminate command that terminates *any* cluster

* Improved performance - using workerpool library
  (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/StarCluster) to configure nodes concurrently

* New ``ebsimage`` and ``s3image`` commands for easily creating new EBS-backed
  AMIs. Each command supports creating a new AMI from S3 and EBS-backed image
  hosts respectively. (NOTE: ``createimage`` has been renamed to s3image. you can
  still call ``createimage`` but this will go away in future releases)

* Add/Remove Nodes - added new ``addnode`` and ``removenode`` commands for
  adding/removing nodes to a cluster and removing existing nodes from a cluster

* Restart command - Added new restart command that reboots the cluster and
  reconfigures the cluster

* Create Keypairs - Added ability to add/list/remove keypairs

* Elastic Load Balancing - Support for shrinking/expanding clusters based on Sun
  Grid Engine queue statistics. This allow the user to start a single-node
  cluster (or larger) and scale the number of instances needed to meet the
  current SGE queue load. For example, a single-node cluster can be launched and
  as the queue load increases new EC2 instances are launched, added to the
  cluster, used for computation, and then removed when they're idle. This
  minimizes the cost of using EC2 for an unknown and on-demand workload. Thanks
  to Rajat Banerjee (rqbanerjee)

* Security Group Permissions - Added ability to specify permission settings to
  be applied automatically to a cluster's security group after it's been started

* Multiple Instance Types - Added support for specifying instance types on a
  per-node basis. Thanks to Dan Yamins for his contributions

* Unpartitioned Volumes- StarCluster now supports both partitioned and
  unpartitioned EBS volumes

* New Plugin Hooks - Plugins can now play a part when adding or removing a node as
  well as when restarting or shutting down the entire cluster by implementing the
  ``on_remove_node``, ``on_add_node``, ``on_shutdown``, and ``on_reboot``
  methods respectively

* Added a ``runplugin`` command and fixed the run_plugin() method in the
  development shell. You can now run a plugin in the dev shell like so::

    ~[1]> cm.run_plugin('myplugin', 'mycluster')

* Added support for easily switching regions (without config changes)
  using a global -z option. For example::

    $ starcluster -r eu-west-1 listclusters
    StarCluster - (http://star.mit.edu/cluster) (v. 0.92rc1)

* Added new ``resizevolume`` command for easily resizing existing EBS volumes

* Added listregions/listzones commands
