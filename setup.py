    StarCluster is a utility for creating and managing computing clusters
    hosted on Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). StarCluster utilizes
    Amazon's EC2 web service to create and destroy clusters of Linux virtual
    machines on demand.

    To get started, the user creates a simple configuration file with their AWS
    account details and a few cluster preferences (e.g. number of machines,
    machine type, ssh keypairs, etc). After creating the configuration file and
    running StarCluster's "start" command, a cluster of Linux machines
    configured with the Sun Grid Engine queuing system, an NFS-shared /home
    directory, and OpenMPI with password-less ssh is created and ready to go
    out-of-the-box. Running StarCluster's "stop" command will shutdown the
    cluster and stop paying for service. This allows the user to only pay for
    what they use.

    StarCluster can also utilize Amazon's Elastic Block Storage (EBS) volumes
    to provide persistent data storage for a cluster. EBS volumes allow you to
    store large amounts of data in the Amazon cloud and are also easy to
    back-up and replicate in the cloud.  StarCluster will mount and NFS-share
    any volumes specified in the config. StarCluster's "createvolume" command
    provides the ability to automatically create, format, and partition new EBS
    volumes for use with StarCluster.

    StarCluster provides a Ubuntu-based Amazon Machine Image (AMI) in 32bit and
    64bit architectures. The AMI contains an optimized NumPy, SciPy, Atlas,
    Blas, Lapack installation compiled for the larger Amazon EC2 instance
    types. The AMI also comes with Sun Grid Engine (SGE) and OpenMPI compiled
    with SGE support. The public AMI can easily be customized by launching a
    single instance of the public AMI, installing additional software on the
    instance, and then using StarCluster's "createimage" command to completely
    automate the process of creating a new AMI from an EC2 instance.
